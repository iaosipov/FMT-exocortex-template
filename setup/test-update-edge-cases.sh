# test-update-edge-cases.sh — edge-case regression tests for update.sh (issue #206)
#
# Covers gaps not exercised by smoke-test-fresh-install.sh:
#   T1: --check mode does not modify any file (idempotency guard)
#   T2: orphaned {{PLACEHOLDER}} in .iwe-runtime/ is detected post-build
#   T3: CLAUDE.md with pre-existing conflict markers blocks update (stacking guard)
#   T4: role install failure surfaces a visible warning (not silently swallowed)
#   T5: network-independent --check works with a cached manifest
#   T6: the owner: marker is read correctly but no longer decides a memory update (issues #229/#965)
#   T7: hot-budget sum over threshold is detectable (issue #228)
#   T8: build-runtime.sh does not clobber an edited params.yaml (issue #327)
#   T9: .mcp.json migration preserves a third-party server like ext-figma (issue #335)
#   T10: CLAUDE.md fallback-merge (no .base) never silently drops §8/§9 edits (issue #336)
#   T11: protocol-artifact-validate.sh DayPlan checks (multiplier/mandatory/budget, issue #328)
#   T12: day-close.sh memory backup descends into memory/ subfolders (issue #343)
#   T13: iwe_scheduler_state separates "never deployed" from "deployed and dead" (issue #347)
#   T14: a fresh workspace is seeded with params.yaml from params.yaml.example (issue #348)
#   T15: residency-gate scripts resolve residency-gate.py from any cwd (issue #323)
#   T16: hooks newly registered in settings.json exist and honor the event protocol on a clean install (issues #310/#321/#323 batch)
#   T17: seed ships scripts/lib/ so a fresh governance install gets the scaffold dependency (issue #347)
#   T18: decision-log consumers share one canonical path and define cold-start/migration behavior (issue #351)
#   T19: orphan detection resolves the template independently of CWD and fails open (issue #353)
#   T20: index-health skip suppresses size checks but keeps semantic checks (issue #357)
#   T21: legacy owner:user protocols follow the memory policy: untouched ones migrate once with a
#        backup, edited ones are kept (issues #354/#965/#967)
#   T22: Quick Close requires a runner card only when the runner and graph exist (issue #356)
#   T23: wp-sync-bundle handles canonical cards, phase statuses, relation shapes, titles, and linked worktrees
#   T24-T27: update safety, bootstrap/path contracts, multiplier opt-out, #384/#387/#388
#   T28: settings.json merge preview never touches inputs, honors merge rules (WP-7 F71)
#   T29: author_mode skip classifier verdicts on synthetic template history (WP-7 F71)
#   T30: update.sh wires stage-A observability scripts in (WP-7 F71)
#   T31: extensions-gate is fail-closed: traversal/symlink/broken-manifest/manifest-edit block (WP-7 F71)
#   T32: settings-merge-apply.sh applies with backup, rolls back on broken input (WP-7 F71 stage B)
#   T33: update.sh wires stage-B flags with consensus safeguards (WP-7 F71)
#   T34: Unicode context caps count characters, not bytes (issue #435)
#   T35: /extend catalog matches every invoked extension point (issues #436/#508)
#   T36: extension loader sorts suffixes and preserves no-op/error exit codes (issue #508)
#   T40: Kimi peer heartbeat stays outside authoritative session admission (WP-484)
#   T41: sync_workspace_claude_md() accepts a hand-resolved conflict instead of
#        re-merging it against the stale base forever; a stale pending record
#        (upstream moved on) is discarded, not silently accepted (issue #846)
#   T42: memory/*.md stale-repair backs up the workspace copy before
#        overwriting it, like .claude/rules/* already does (issue #847)
#   T43: Step 6 (the main apply path) keeps a memory file the pilot edited, backs up and names
#        a file it replaces because the pilot never changed it (issues #967/#965)
#   T44: the author_mode "stale" hint runs on exactly the printed paths (a space, quotes,
#        $(...), backticks and a backslash in them) and two runs keep two copies
#   T45: the same for the memory policy's command for a kept copy; a refreshed copy on such
#        paths gets its backup (cold review of #967)
#   T46: one memory policy for every owner: untouched copies refreshed with a backup (proof by
#        the version installed last time or by the clone's history), edited or unverifiable
#        ones kept with a command; shallow clone, failed backup, repeated update, migration,
#        odd paths, author_mode, the record of installed versions (issues #965/#967)
#   T47: the record of installed memory versions (.memory-deployed.tsv): a broken-off run and a
#        copy several releases behind, an unusable record, setup.sh's first record, author_mode
#        in Step 6 and the repair pass (review of #965/#967)
#   T48: the record before Step 5 (a run broken off before Step 6), atomic writes of the record and
#        of memory copies, unreadable or linked record, every file left as it was in the summary
#        (review-12 of #965/#967)

> Hot-триггер: `CLAUDE.md`, Agent Core. Этот файл обязателен целиком, когда в
> governance-репозитории существует `docs/state-axes-registry.yaml` (WP-457).

Перед любым нетривиальным действием или РП назвать целевой переход состояния
пользователя в форме `{тип состояния, из→в}`.

## Допустимый переход

1. Тип состояния брать только из того же
   `docs/state-axes-registry.yaml` governance-репозитория, наличие которого
   активировало hot-триггер.
2. Использовать только ось с `gate_ready: true`.
3. Дать ссылку на объявленного владельца конечного автомата
   (`declared FSM-owner`) этой оси.
4. Свободный текст вместо зарегистрированного типа состояния не принимается.

Если тип не зарегистрирован, ось не имеет `gate_ready: true` или ссылка на
владельца отсутствует, разрешён только сбор фактов (`inventory`) → СТОП и
отложить нетривиальное действие или РП.

Для перехода по нескольким осям применять правила cross-axis из
`memory/reference/agent-core.md`. Авторская концептуальная модель может быть
доступна в `archive/wp-contexts/WP-457/CONCEPT-user-states.md §5`, но не является
обязательной для понимания и исполнения этого поставляемого контракта.
