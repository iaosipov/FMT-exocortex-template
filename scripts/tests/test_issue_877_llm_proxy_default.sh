# test_issue_877_llm_proxy_default.sh - regression for issue #877.
#
# scripts/day-open-pipeline.sh defaulted LLM_PROXY_URL to the maintainer's
# private Railway gateway. A user install has no secret for it, so the morning
# pipeline died on an anonymous probe (HTTP 401) that read like a key-rotation
# problem; meanwhile setup.sh wrote PLATFORM_LLM_PROXY_URL for every user and no
# script ever read it. Contract now:
#   1. no built-in gateway address in the shipped script (or its seed snapshot);
#   2. resolution: LLM_PROXY_URL > PLATFORM_LLM_PROXY_URL (environment, then the
#      workspace env file) > empty; the platform value's "/v1" suffix is stripped
#      because the calls append their own "/v1/...";
#   3. empty -> step 2 aborts with a direct "not configured" message and never
#      probes an empty URL;
#   4. setup.sh no longer records the dead platform endpoint as an active value.
# The real blocks are extracted from the script, not re-typed.
