# Regression coverage for the ds-publish.sh side finding of issue #884: since
# WP-7 Ф101 strategist.sh publishes only through $WORKSPACE/scripts/ds-publish.sh,
# a script the template never shipped. On a template install every scheduled
# run logged a bare "No such file or directory" and the commit never reached
# origin. The publish step now says the script is missing and keeps the commit
# local; with the script present it behaves exactly as before.
